# LiveBusTracker

Description:
Uses asynchronous functions to constantly fetch GPS coordinates of a bus that belongs to the MBTA route 1. Updates the location of the map marker after each fetch is retrieved to pin point bus location.


How to Run:
Load webpage and click on the button on the top left corner "Track MBTA Route 1"


Roadmap:
Implement functions to track more bus routes and include all vehicles in the route as opposed to just a single one.

Implement another major city.
